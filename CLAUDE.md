1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the [todo.md] file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
8. Don't use Unicode characters like emoji/icons in the code.
9. Try to run commands in the Command Prompt on your own. Only if u face timeout errors, or feel that the command has security risk, then stop and give me the command. I will run it for u and give u the output.
10. If you write .md files for documentation or analysis, store it in docs folder.
11. If you write file for testing, after testing is finished, store it in tests folder
12. If you write cypher files, store it in cypher folder
